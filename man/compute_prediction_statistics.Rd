compute_prediction_statistics(
  y,
  t_pred,
  initial_expiry_data = c(0, 0),
  initial_collection_data = c(60, 60, 60),
  start = 10,
  c = 30
)
}
\arguments{
\item{y}{is the number of units used at the current day i}

\item{t_pred}{is the sum of the predicted number of units for days
i+1, i+2, i+3}

\item{initial_expiry_data}{the number of units that can be used the
current day and the next (2-length vector)}

\item{initial_collection_data}{is the number of units to collect
for days i, i+1, i+2}

\item{start}{is when we start the clock. So for example, in this
default invocation the shelf storage (initial_collection_data)
was 60, 60, 60, on days 10, 11, and 12. So the evaluation of
the model begins at day 11 but the decision to order collection
starts on day 13.}

\item{c}{the ideal minimum number of fresh units remaining at the end
of the day. this is also the minimum number that should be collected}
}
\value{
a list with four components, \code{x} is the number of
    units to collect, \code{r} is a matrix of two columns
    indicating remaining units usable on day i+1 and day i+2,
    \code{w} is waste, and \code{s} is shortage.
}
\description{
Compute three-day predicted usage, waste, remaining and shortage
using the actual usage and predicted usage.
